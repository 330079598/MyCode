---

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i]` is the **type** of fruit the `ith` tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

- You only have **two** baskets, and each basket can only hold a **single type** of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
- Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick **exactly one fruit** from **every** tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
- Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.

Given the integer array `fruits`, return *the **maximum** number of fruits you can pick*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= fruits.length <= 105`
- `0 <= fruits[i] < fruits.length`



**题解**

```java
/**
* 时间复杂度：O(n)，其中 n 是数组 fruits 的长度。
* 空间复杂度：O(1)。哈希表中最多会有三个键值对，可以看成使用了常数级别的空间。
*/
class Solution {
    public int totalFruit(int[] fruits) {
        int n = fruits.length;
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        int left = 0, count = 0;
        for(int right = 0;right < n;right ++){
            map.put(fruits[right],map.getOrDefault(fruits[right], 0) + 1); // 加一的原因：防止map里面的数据被覆盖
            while(map.size() > 2){
                map.put(fruits[left], map.get(fruits[left]) - 1);
                if(map.get(fruits[left]) == 0){
                    map.remove(fruits[left]);
                }
                left ++;
            }
            count = Math.max(count, right - left + 1);
        }
         return count;
    }
}
```
